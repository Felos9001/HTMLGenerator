# HTMLGenerator - Felos - compliments to BroCode
# I learned a bit of HTML today and decided to commit this project, it generates an HTML file written from JAVA

How to process the HTML file: 

Step 1) download the source code onto any Java IDE of your choice

Step 2) open the HTML "helloworld" file (you may rename the file if you wish) 

Step 3) change the contents of the file to whatever you want (In my case I wrote "Appa doesnt feel like flying today") 

Step 4) once you have written what you like, open the file on a web browser

Step 6) you should now see what you have written onto the web browser
